### ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Janis


I am a designer, I strive for development and improvement. Climbing a rocky mountain of programming, the path is not easy, but it is not impossible, I believe that a person learns all his life and knowledge is gained more and more.
If you donâ€™t give up, you can do anything!
